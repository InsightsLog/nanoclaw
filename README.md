## What This Is

A personal forex macro-fundamental trading assistant built on [NanoClaw](https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw) — a lightweight AI agent that runs Claude in isolated containers with WhatsApp as the I/O channel. This fork transforms it into a specialized tool for fundamentals-driven forex traders, adding macroeconomic analysis, sentiment briefings, event-release signals, central bank tracking, and automated macro monitoring. No technical analysis — strictly fundamentals.

## Features

- **Macro Sentiment Briefs** — Daily structured briefings with impact score, risk-on/off regime, sentiment score, key drivers, and actionable pair bias
- **Event-Release Signals** — Instant sentiment alerts at release-time with actual vs. forecast, market reaction, regime shift detection, and fundamental trade rationale
- **Central Bank Tracking** — Monitor monetary policy across Fed, ECB, BoE, BoJ, RBA, BoC, RBNZ, SNB with rate differential analysis
- **Economic Calendar** — Monitor high-impact events from ForexFactory and other sources
- **Macro-Fundamental Analysis** — Rate differentials, GDP, CPI, employment, PMI, trade balance — no technicals
- **Live Forex Prices** — Fetch real-time exchange rates using free public APIs (no API key required)
- **Trade Journaling** — Persistent trade logs with entry/exit, fundamental rationale, and P&L tracking
- **Position Management** — Track open positions, watchlists, and portfolio exposure
- **Risk Calculations** — Position sizing, risk/reward ratios, pip value calculations
- **Automated Alerts** — Schedule macro monitoring, sentiment briefs, and event alerts via WhatsApp
- **Web Research** — Search for macro news, central bank commentary, and economic data
- **AI-Powered Analysis** — Claude provides intelligent macroeconomic interpretation and trading insights
- **Container Isolation** — All processing runs in sandboxed Linux containers for security
- **Agent Swarms** — Spin up teams of specialized agents (e.g., one per central bank)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InsightsLog/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw
claude
```

Then run `/setup`. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration.

## Usage

Talk to your trading assistant with the trigger word (default: `@Andy`):

### Macro-Fundamental Analysis
```
@Andy what's driving EUR/USD right now — what are the macro fundamentals?
@Andy compare the Fed vs ECB rate path — who cuts first?
@Andy what high-impact events are on the economic calendar this week?
@Andy give me a fundamental breakdown of USD/JPY — rate differentials, BoJ policy, inflation
@Andy what's the current risk regime — risk-on or risk-off?
```

### Trade Management
```
@Andy I went long EUR/USD at 1.0850 with SL at 1.0800 and TP at 1.0950, 0.5 lots

@Andy show my open positions
@Andy what's my P&L for this week?
```

```

## Architecture

```
WhatsApp (baileys) --> SQLite --> Polling loop --> Container (Claude Agent SDK + Forex Skills) --> Response
```

Single Node.js process. Claude agents execute in isolated Linux containers with forex macro-fundamental skills loaded automatically. The agent uses free public APIs and web browsing to fetch economic data, central bank statements, and market rates. Sentiment briefs and trade data persist in the group workspace between sessions.

### Key Files
- `src/index.ts` — Main app: WhatsApp connection, message loop, IPC
- `src/container-runner.ts` — Spawns streaming agent containers
- `src/task-scheduler.ts` — Runs scheduled market monitoring tasks
- `src/db.ts` — SQLite operations (messages, groups, sessions, state)
- `container/skills/forex-trading/SKILL.md` — Forex macro-fundamental capabilities (sentiment briefs, event signals, central bank tracking, economic calendar)
- `container/skills/agent-browser/SKILL.md` — Browser automation for economic data sites
- `groups/main/CLAUDE.md` — Main channel agent memory and configuration
- `groups/global/CLAUDE.md` — Shared agent context across all groups

### Data Sources (No API Keys Required)
- **Exchange Rates**: [ExchangeRate-API](https://open.er-api.com/), [Frankfurter](https://api.frankfurter.app/), [FloatRates](https://www.floatrates.com/)
- **Economic Calendar**: [ForexFactory](https://www.forexfactory.com/) (via agent-browser), Forex Factory JSON feed
- **Central Banks**: Fed, ECB, BoE, BoJ websites (via agent-browser and web search)
- **Macro News & Data**: Web search via built-in WebSearch tool, Investing.com

### Persistent Data
| Data | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Sentiment Briefs | `groups/main/sentiment/daily/` | Daily macro sentiment briefings |
| Sentiment Alerts | `groups/main/sentiment/alerts/` | Event-release signal snapshots |
| Sentiment Summary | `groups/main/sentiment/summary.md` | Rolling regime and score tracker |
| Trade Journal | `groups/main/trades/` | Individual trade entries with fundamental rationale |
| Portfolio | `groups/main/portfolio.md` | Active positions and P&L |
| Watchlist | `groups/main/watchlist.md` | Monitored pairs with macro catalysts |
| Preferences | `groups/main/preferences.md` | Trading style, risk tolerance, timezone |
| Conversations | `groups/main/conversations/` | Searchable chat history |

## Customizing

There are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:

- "Change the trigger word to @Trader"
- "I trade macro fundamentals only — focus on rate differentials and central bank policy"
- "My account is $25,000 with 1:100 leverage at IC Markets"
- "I only trade EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY — update my watchlist"
- "Add a pre-market routine that checks overnight macro releases and central bank headlines"

Or run `/customize` for guided changes.

## Philosophy

This project inherits NanoClaw's core philosophy:

**Small enough to understand.** One process, a few source files. No microservices, no abstraction layers.

**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers. They can only see what's explicitly mounted.

**Built for one user.** This is working software for a forex trader's specific needs. Fork it and customize.

**AI-native.** No dashboards or configuration GUIs. Talk to Claude to configure, debug, and customize.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Node.js 20+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS) or [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (macOS/Linux)
